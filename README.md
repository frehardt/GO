# Freeride Kite GO

![Kite GO](https://github.com/wingworks/GO/blob/master/GO_S_perspective.png)

You are interested in designing and building your own tube kite? But you don't know how to start?
Where to get the plans and the right materials?  
Then you should join this Open Kite Build project!

The tube kite GO in size S (9sqm) is a modern freeride kite. Easy to relaunch, suitable for beginners and experts.
The big difference between the GO and all the other freeride kites on the market is that **YOU** can get involved in the design process. Give feedback, build your own version, improove the design and learn a lot about kite design and aerodynamics in general.

## Getting started

You can find the first release of the GO as Release GO-S-alpha-0.1 in the [release section](https://github.com/wingworks/GO/releases).

The kite wasn't build yet but it is based on the prooved design of my single strut freeride kite "Ventus" which is also available on Github in the [Ventus Repository](https://github.com/karsteng/Ventus-S).

The release contains the following files:
* Kite design parameters (GO_S.kite)
* 3D kite model (GO_S.blend)
* Kite plan as DXF file (GO_S.dxf)

## First steps

1. Take a look at the kite design parameters and the 3D model of the kite to get an idea of the flying characteristics  
1. Read the Howto in the Wiki  
1. Study the DXF kite plan  

**Give feedback and [join in](#join-in)!**

1. Build the kite
2. Fly the kite in different conditions
3. Optimize bridle settings
4. Contribute your experiances

## Prerequisities

Recommended Software:
- CAD Software (e.g. [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org)) to open and edit the DXF plans
- Open Source Software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to view the 3D kite model

## Material
For best performance and comparablity it is very important to use proper materials to build the kite. Thanks to our partner [extremtextil.de](http://extremtextil.de) you can get all required fabrics in high quality and different colors online.

**Polyester Dacron**

Dacron is used for the leading edge, struts and to reinforce the sail
* [Dimension Polyant 170g/sqm Dacron](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=dacron&x=10&y=11)

**Kite Polyester Spinnaker**

Polyester spinnaker fabrics rely on their tight Polyester yarn to resits stretch. In comparison to nylon fabrics they do not change their characteristics when exposed to water and sun.
* [Kite Polyester Spinnaker (50g/sqm)](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/Double-Ripstop-Kite-Polyester-hight-tenacity-PU-coated-53g-sqm::2868.html)

**TPU**

TPU is used for the leading edge and strut bladders
* [TPU for Kite Bladders](http://www.extremtextil.de/catalog/TPU-film-transparent-0-1mm-thick-110g-sqm-for-Kite-Bladder::2801.html)

You can also get 'ready to install' bladders for the GO from [bonobo repair](http://bonoborepair.de/de/Kite-Bladder/).

**Kite recycling**

If you have an old kite in a very good condition and don't mind the extra work for cutting and sewing the GO panels out of several pieces then you can 'upcycle' your old kite.
Remove all seams and use the same fabric orientation.

## HowTo sew the kite

There will be a howto coming soon on the wiki. Until then please refer to the [wingworks kite sewing manual](http://www.wingworks.de/bauanleitungen/tube-kite/bauanleitung/) (german only)

## Kite design software

![WingCalc Kite Software](http://www.wingworks.de/wp-content/uploads/wingcalc_kite_software-2-300x169.png)

To create the 3D Model of the kite and the dxf plans I'm using my software [WingCalc](http://www.wingworks.de/kite-design/3d-software-wingcalc/). The software is not part of the project and not (yet) OpenSource. I'm also working on an onlineversion to make it available for everyone.
